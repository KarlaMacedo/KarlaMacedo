# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ IÂ´m Karla!

**I am a woman in constant evolution and adaptability!**

I consider that my curiosity, love for mental challenges, and passion for nature drive me to pursue continuous learning.
That's why I studied a Bachelor's degree in Biology, allowing me to develop my logical and systematic thinking in research
and problem-solving. Later on, through the development of my master's thesis, I discovered the R programming language, which
opened my eyes to the power of programming. Currently, I am enhancing my immersion in this field by focusing on web development,
using the SCRUM methodology, to create innovative digital solutions that can transform the world and benefit society and the
environment. This keeps me motivated to continue learning and improving my skills.
